## A statement of need ##

### What is DataCleaningTool? ###
DataCleaningTool is a user friendly, free and open source standalone application in order to support the task of data cleaning in a cooperative way. The tool can identify the potential data problems and report results such that the users can make informed decisions to clean data effectively. 

### Why is DataCleaningTool needed? ###
The primary ideas behind developing DataCleaningTool are the following.

1. **Time effectivity** - Data cleaning is a time daunting task to go through manually large number of datasets for identifying the errors. DataCleaningTool is an application for systematically examining data for errors and automatically cleaning them using algorithms.  

2. **Cooperativeness** - DataCleaningTool is not a black box which implies that it does not produce any result which cannot be easily understandable by the user. It motivates and illustrates its suggestions. However, the user is always in control who takes the final action at every stage of the data cleaning process.

3. **Addressing reasonable number of data problems which cause erroneous conclusion and failing algorithms** - DataCleaningTool aims to clean data by resolving inconsistencies, smoothing noisy data, dealing with outliers or imputing missing observations using model based imputation method.
