## A statement of need ##
DataCleaningTool is a user friendly, free and open source standalone application in order to support the task of data cleaning in a cooperative way. The tool can identify the potential data problems and report results such that the users can make informed decisions to clean data effectively. The primary ideas behind developing DataCleaningTool are the following.

1. **Time effectivity** - Data cleaning is a time consuming task to go through manually such large number of datasets for identifying the errors. This demands data cleaning tools  for systematically examining data for errors and automatically cleaning them using algorithms. DataCleaningTool is such a tool which can help with the task.

2. **Cooperativeness** - DataCleaningTool is not a black box which implies that it does not produce any result which cannot be easily understandable by the user. It motivates and illustrates its suggestions. However, the user is always in control who takes the final action at every stage of the data cleaning process.

3. **Addressing reasonable number of data problems which cause erroneous conclusion and failing algorithms** - DataCleaningTool aims to clean data by resolving inconsistencies, smoothing noisy data, dealing with outliers or imputing missing observations using model based imputation method.
